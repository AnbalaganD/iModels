* <b>Update the device model list:</b> If you identify missing or outdated models, submit a pull request to update the list.
* <b>Implement new features:</b> If you have ideas for features that would enhance the library's functionality, propose them through an issue or pull request.
* <b>Fix bugs:</b> If you encounter any bugs, report them as issues and consider submitting a pull request with a fix.

## <u>Testing Requirements:</u>

* <b>Add unit tests:</b> All new changes must include appropriate unit tests to verify functionality.
* <b>Maintain existing tests:</b> Ensure that your changes do not break any existing unit tests.
* <b>Run tests locally:</b> Execute `swift test` before submitting to verify all tests pass.
